## Overall solution

The approach I chose was to create the acceptance tests as a happy flow for a scheduled job in the Sandbox Dashboard Web. <br/> For the API, I did a POST, GET, CANCEL job flow.  <br/> For these I used: JavaScript, WebDriverIO, Mocha, Chai and Chai-http. <br/>
The Dashboard tests were done in a PageObject approach, trying to encapsulate as much logic as possible inside the Page classes. <br/>

There are two spec files:
- **specs/jobFlowAPI.js** (which contains the acceptance test for the API)
- **specs/scheduleNewEventDashboard.js** (which contains the acceptance test for the Dashboard)

## How to run the tests:
1. Installed Chrome 87
2. Run **npm install**
3. Run **npm run test**

## Sample run test report
